<h2>History</h2>
<p>Durham House of Pets was founded in 2004 by John Smith. John grew up with a tremendous love for animals. <br> He always dreamed of owning his own pet store one day. John never imagined DHP would become what it is <br> today. In 2004, DHP was a small pet store that sold food, bedding, and accessories for many animals such as <br> dogs, cats, fish, ferrets, and other small pets. Today, DHP has expanded and offers grooming services, training <br> services, and a doggy day care. </p>
